This package adds additional completions to the PHP Intelephense extension.
It is not created by the same author as PHP Intelephense.
I will try to remove features as they are added to official PHP Intelephense extension.

## Features
- `$_SERVER` completions (see https://github.com/bmewburn/vscode-intelephense/issues/435).
- PHPDoc function argument completions (see https://github.com/bmewburn/vscode-intelephense/issues/706).
